**Detecting Hand-Written Mathematical Expressions**

**Methodology**

**1. Dataset Preparation**

   - The dataset consists of images and corresponding labels stored in CSV files.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
   - The Pandas library is used to load and manipulate the data.
   - A custom PyTorch Dataset class (SymbolDataset) is created to:
      - Load images from disk.
      - Convert them to grayscale.
      - Apply necessary transformations such as resizing and normalization.
      - Return the image and label for training purposes.
  
**Use Case:**

  - Used in OCR systems where grayscale images of characters or symbols need classification.
  - Applied in traffic sign recognition, where each sign represents a category.


**2. Data Preprocessing**

  - Images are resized to 32x32 pixels to ensure consistency.
  - Normalization is applied using mean = 0.5 and standard deviation = 0.5.
  - The dataset is converted into a PyTorch DataLoader for efficient batch processing.

**Use Case:**

  - Preprocessing is essential in facial recognition systems where a uniform input size is required.
  - Used in medical imaging to standardize X-ray image sizes.


**3. Model Architecture**

**A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented using PyTorch with the following layers:**

  - Convolutional layers:
    - Conv2D (1-32 filters) + ReLU + MaxPooling (2×2)
    - Conv2D (32-64 filters) + ReLU + MaxPooling (2x2)
      
  - Fully Connected Layers:
    - Linear (64×8×8512) + ReLU + Dropout (0.5)
    - Linear (512-369) (output layer for classification)

  - Activation Functions:
    - ReLU is used for hidden layers.
    - The final layer outputs raw logits for CrossEntropyLoss.

**Use Case:**

  - Used in license plate recognition systems where a CNN processes text symbols.
  - Applied in industrial defect detection where symbols indicate product status.
    

**4. Training the Model**

  - Loss function: Cross-Entropy Loss
  - Optimizer: Adam Optimizer (learning rate = 0.001)
  - Epochs: 10
  - Batch size: 64

**Use Case:**

  - Used in self-driving car systems to classify road symbols.
  - Applied in robotics to help robots recognize warning or instruction symbols.


**5. Model Evaluation & Inference**

  - The trained model is saved as _symbol_classifier.pth._
  - During inference:
    - The model is set to evaluation mode.
    - O Predictions are made on the test dataset.
    - The results are saved as _submission.csv._

**Use Case:**

  - Used in mobile applications that scan and classify handwritten symbols.
  - Applied in security systems to recognize authentication symbols.
    

**Results & Improvements**

  - Model performance is evaluated based on accuracy.
  - Potential improvements include:
    - Data Augmentation: Adding random rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments.
    - Using deeper architectures: Exploring models like ResNet.
    - O Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and dropout rates.
    - Increasing dataset size: More diverse samples may improve generalization.


**Conclusion**

This project successfully implements a CNN-based classifier for symbol recognition using PyTorch. The model learns from grayscale images and achieves reasonable accuracy within a few epochs. Further optimizations and enhancements can significantly improve performance
